	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity measure an algorithm's efficiency in terms of execution time, memory usage, and overall resource demand relative to input size.	</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity measures how efficiently an algorithm runs as input size grows.
	</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> often denoted as O(n), represents the memory required by an algorithm in relation to the input size.
